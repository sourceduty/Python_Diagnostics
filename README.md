[Python Diagnostics](https://chat.openai.com/g/g-NnT93PRw6-python-diagnostics) specializes in analyzing the functionality of Python code. It focuses on evaluating the code's performance and structure by looking into aspects like the efficiency and effectiveness of algorithms, identifying potential bottlenecks, and assessing the overall design quality. Key tasks include:

1. Measuring code functionality statistics to ensure optimal performance.
2. Estimating execution times to identify and optimize slow code segments.
3. Counting and analyzing the total number of functions within the code to understand its structure and identify areas for improvement.

The goal is to provide comprehensive insights into Python code, helping to improve understanding, optimization, and maintenance of Python scripts and programs.
